# How to use Github for Source Code Management(SCM)

### Python itself comes with venv for managing environments which we will use for this guide. To create a virtual environment for your project, open a new command prompt, navigate to the folder where you want to create your project and then enter the following:
```bash
py -3 -m venv venv_name
```

### To activate the environment, run: (If you can not activate the virtual enviroment, you need to Kill the Terminal and type in below command again)
```bash
venv_name\Scripts\activate.bat
```

#### The virtual environment will be activated and you’ll see “(venv_name)” next to the command prompt to designate that. Each time you start a new command prompt, you’ll need to activate the environment again.
